Thoughts:

<h2>Things it should be easy to do:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Send a message</li>
<li>Receive a message (register to receive messages, whatever)</li>

<p>Would it be useful is the tasks could send a message to system when they start?</p>
<p>In particular, I'm thinking about the "tasks" page not updating when you click on a button.
system could broadcast out status update messages, so 'tasks' could listen for them and update.
Other tasks could listen for e.g. newly created tasks or track uptime, etc.</p>
